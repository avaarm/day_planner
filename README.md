# [Work Day Scheduler](https://avaarm.github.io/day_planner/)

## Description 

This is a frontend Javascript application that utilizes a third-party API called Moment, a time and date library. Throught this project I learned how to implement jQuery UI to make a webpage more user-friendly and how to use jQuery to perform DOM manipulation and traversals and implement interactivity using event handlers.
